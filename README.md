# While Loop Practice Assignment

## Instructions

This assignment will help you practice using while loops in Python. There are two tasks to complete:

### Task 1: Counting by Twos
Write a while loop that prints all even numbers from 2 to 50 (inclusive). Your program should print each number on a new line.

### Task 2: Grid Pattern
Write nested while loops to create a 5x5 grid of # symbols. Your program should print a grid that looks like this:

```
#####
#####
#####
#####
#####
```

## How to Submit
1. Edit the `assignment.py` file to complete both tasks.
2. Do NOT modify any other files.
3. Commit and push your changes to GitHub.
4. The autograder will run tests to check your solutions.

## Testing Your Code
You can manually test your code by running the assignment.py file. The correct output should show all even numbers from 2 to 50 and a 5x5 grid of # symbols.

Good luck!
